The \doxyref{Soapy\+L\+M\+S7}{p.}{d9/d90/classSoapyLMS7} wrapper provides Soapy\+S\+DR bindings for Lime\+Suite devices using the L\+M\+S7 A\+PI. The wrapper builds along side the Lime\+Suite compilation when Soapy\+S\+DR development files are detected.

\doxyref{Soapy\+L\+M\+S7}{p.}{d9/d90/classSoapyLMS7} allows Lime\+Suite devices to be used in applications that use the Soapy\+S\+DR A\+PI such as Cubic\+S\+DR, Pothos, G\+N\+U\+Radio, Gr\+Osmosdr. In addition, the A\+PI supports Python and remote access bindings.
