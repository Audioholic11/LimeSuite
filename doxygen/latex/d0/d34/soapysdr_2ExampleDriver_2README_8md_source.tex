00001 # Example module build for SoapySDR device support
00002 
00003 Copy this example wholesale either as a new cmake build project,
00004 or copy it into a subdirectory of an existing driver build system.
00005 Customize the CMakeLists.txt for your driver dependencies,
00006 and customize MyDeviceSupport.cpp to make calls into the
00007 low-level device driver for streaming and configuration.
