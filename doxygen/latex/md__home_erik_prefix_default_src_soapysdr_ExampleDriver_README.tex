Copy this example wholesale either as a new cmake build project, or copy it into a subdirectory of an existing driver build system. Customize the C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt for your driver dependencies, and customize \doxyref{My\+Device\+Support.\+cpp}{p.}{dc/d9d/MyDeviceSupport_8cpp} to make calls into the low-\/level device driver for streaming and configuration.
