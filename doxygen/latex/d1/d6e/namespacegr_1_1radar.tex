\item 
class {\bf crop\+\_\+matrix\+\_\+vcvc}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This matrix crops a data matrix. A tagged stream combined with vectors as items represent a matrix. crop\+\_\+x and crop\+\_\+y gives the ranges which shall be pushed through. Rest of the matrix is lost. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class {\bf crop\+\_\+matrix\+\_\+vcvc\+\_\+impl}
\item 
class {\bf estimator\+\_\+cw}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This block estimates the velocity from given peaks of a CW spectrum. The estimator looks for a f32vector tagged with a \textquotesingle{}frequency\textquotesingle{} identifier (symbol) and calculates the velocity with the doppler formula. The identifier (symbol) of the output data is \textquotesingle{}velocity\textquotesingle{}. Needed identifier (symbols) of the input are \textquotesingle{}frequency\textquotesingle{}. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class {\bf estimator\+\_\+cw\+\_\+impl}
\item 
class {\bf estimator\+\_\+fmcw}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This block estimates range and veloicty from peaks of a F\+M\+CW spectrum. Input messages are data with the identifier \textquotesingle{}frequency\textquotesingle{} of the up-\/chirp, down-\/chirp and CW part. If data is available on all three message ports the estimation starts. The velocity is estimated with the frequency information of the CW block and the range is estimated with the up and down chirp. If multiple frequencies are given, the velocity is estimated first and associated with the most likely range from the up-\/ and down-\/chirp. The output identifiers are \textquotesingle{}range\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}velocity\textquotesingle{}. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class {\bf estimator\+\_\+fmcw\+\_\+impl}
\item 
class {\bf estimator\+\_\+fsk}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This block estimates the range with peaks given from a F\+SK spectrum. Needed identifiers (symbols) are \textquotesingle{}frequency\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}phase\textquotesingle{}. The velocity is calculated with the \textquotesingle{}frequency\textquotesingle{} information and the doppler formula. The phase of the doppler peaks are used to estimate the range. Output identifier are \textquotesingle{}range\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}velocity\textquotesingle{}. If push\+\_\+power is true the information about the power of the peaks is pushed through. This can be used for estimating the R\+CS of an object. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class {\bf estimator\+\_\+fsk\+\_\+impl}
\item 
class {\bf estimator\+\_\+ofdm}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This block evaluates the peaks given from a O\+F\+DM matrix. Input are the bins of the peaks with the identifiers \textquotesingle{}axis\+\_\+x\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}axis\+\_\+y\textquotesingle{}. The parameters of the block axis\+\_\+x and axis\+\_\+y are vectors which define the mapping of the axis. If two values are given it is assumed a linear progression in between. If four values are given the middle values are set on half of the axis and it is interpolated linear in between. len\+\_\+x and len\+\_\+y gives the length of the axis in number of bins. symbol\+\_\+x and symbol\+\_\+y defines the identifier (symbols) for the output data. merge\+\_\+consecutive toggles merging consecutive peaks. Each peak is compared with peaks in a range of one bin. If there is a peak with a higher power the actual bin is not used for evaluations. If merge\+\_\+consecutive is true data with identifier \textquotesingle{}power\textquotesingle{} is needed. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class {\bf estimator\+\_\+ofdm\+\_\+impl}
\item 
class {\bf estimator\+\_\+rcs}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Basic R\+CS block for estimating the R\+CS of a single target. Some hardware specs need to be known for calculating R\+CS values, see parameters for details. The radar equation is used to calculate the R\+CS\+: R\+CS = Pr$\ast$(4pi)$^\wedge$3$\ast$\+R$^\wedge$4/(Pt$\ast$\+Gt$\ast$\+Gr$\ast$lamda$^\wedge$2). The Rx power (Pr) and the distance (R) are being estimated, while the other parameters are given in the flowgraph. It is possible to average a number of samples by setting the num\+\_\+mean value $>$ 1. The R\+CS will be 0 until enough samples are collected to calculate the mean value (be patient). The Tx power (Pt) needs to be calibrated with external hardware. I recommend to calibrate for the wanted power and not to change the parameters in the flowgraph on the Tx side after that. The R\+CS block needs the Rx power, to estimate the R\+CS. For that, the input power of the block needs to be determined analytically and altered via the corr\+\_\+factor and exponent values, to fit the following equation\+: Pr = P\+\_\+input $^\wedge$ (exponent) $\ast$ corr\+\_\+factor / Pt. In addition, the F\+F\+Ts need to be normalized for correct power calculation. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

class {\bf estimator\+\_\+sync\+\_\+pulse\+\_\+c}

For example the constant number of delay samples due to hardware effect from a signal source can be estimated. The calculation of the shift is done by a cross correlation of the input signals. The number of correlations in samples is given with num\+\_\+xcorr. The output message is the number of delay samples with the identifier (symbol) \textquotesingle{}sync\+\_\+pulse\textquotesingle{}. This can be displayed with the \textquotesingle{}Print Results\textquotesingle{} block. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

Output is a message with the information of frequency, phase and power of the peak as a f32vector with a single item. All data is tagged with the identifiers (symbols) \textquotesingle{}frequency\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}phase\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}power\textquotesingle{}. The peak is estimated on the whole spectrum or on the range max\+\_\+freq if cut\+\_\+max\+\_\+freq is true. Furthermore a threshold of the spectrum amplitude can be given with threshold. The DC peak can be cut out with the protected samples samp\+\_\+protect. This value do not evaluate samp\+\_\+protect samples around the DC peak. If no suitable peak is found the block returns empty vectors with the identifiers. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

Input has to be a matrix with linear scaled values (N\+OT logarithmic scaled!). Used algorithm is a 2D O\+S-\/\+C\+F\+AR algorithm.

Index 0 of a input vector refers to x axis properties and index 1 refers to y axis properties. The relative threshold is defined by the bin of the vector within the sorted samp\+\_\+compare samples.
