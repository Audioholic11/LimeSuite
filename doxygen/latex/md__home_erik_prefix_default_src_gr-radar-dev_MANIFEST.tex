The {\itshape gr-\/radar} project provides a toolbox of commonly used radar algorithms. An important part is the {\itshape U\+HD Echotimer}, which enables a synchronized TX and RX stream from U\+S\+R\+Ps to ensure a constant phase relation in measurements. Example flowgraphs for CW, Dual CW, F\+SK, F\+M\+CW and O\+F\+DM radar are given and partly tested on hardware. G\+UI elements for target representation and further signal processing algorithms such as target tracking are implemented. Check out the project website for example videos and further information.

This project was initiated as a Google Summer of Code project and developed at the {\itshape Communication Engineering Lab (C\+EL)} at the {\itshape Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (K\+IT)}, Germany, {\tt http\+://www.\+cel.\+kit.\+edu}.
