00001 # Build Python version 3 bindings only
00002 
00003 The python3/ directory is essentially a copy of the top level python/ directory,
00004 however it looks solely for the Python version 3 executable and development files.
00005 This directory is only activated when the top level python/ directory
00006 is configured to build for a Python version 2 environment.
00007 
00008 The purpose of the python3/ directory is allow for building both
00009 Python version 2 and Python version 3 language bindings
00010 on systems that support both Python installs simultaneously.
00011 This also allows the debian packaging to build debs for both versions as well.
